<H2 STYLE="COLOR:GREEN;">HTML5 Content Models </H2>
<P STYLE="font-size:30px">In HTML5, the content of a web page can be divided into semantic groups, which describe its content.
 These groups are called content models. Each of these models describes the type of elements it contains. The content model
 can contain text and child elements. The element can belong to one or more content categories.

HTML5 content models are listed below:

<LI>Metadata content</LI>
<LI>Flow content</LI>
<LI>Sectioning content</LI>
<LI>Heading content</LI>
<LI>Phrasing content</LI>
<LI>Embedded content</LI>
<LI>Interactive content</LI>
<LI>Palpable content</LI>
<BR>
<H2>Content models can overlap, and it means that elements are belonging to several categories in the meantime. For example,
 sectioning, heading, phrasing, embedded, interactive, and a part of metadata content refer to flow content.
 Metadata and interactive content in certain cases may refer to phrasing content.

There are also elements that are used for specific purposes, for example, for defining forms.
 Such kind of elements does not refer to any of the content mentioned above models.</H2>
