<P STYLE="font-size:30px">The Great Stupa is also called stupa no. 1. It was originally built in the 3rd century BCE by
 the Mauryan emperor Ashoka. It is believed to house the ashes of the Buddha. His intention behind constructing this Stupa was
 to protect and spread the Buddhist philosophy and way of life.

<P STYLE="font-size:30px">Sanchi is a Buddhist complex, famous for its Great Stupa, on a hilltop at Sanchi Town in 
Raisen District of the State of Madhya Pradesh, India. It is located, about 23 kilometres from Raisen town, district
 headquarter and 46 kilometres (29 mi) north-east of Bhopal, capital of Madhya Pradesh.
The Great Stupa at Sanchi is one of the oldest stone structures in India, and an important monument of Indian Architecture.
 It was originally commissioned by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka the Great in the 3rd century BCE. Its nucleus was a simple 
hemispherical brick structure built over the relics of the Buddha. It was crowned by the 'chhatra', a parasol-like structure
 symbolising high rank, which was intended to honour and shelter the relics. The original construction work of this stupa was
 overseen by Ashoka, whose wife Devi was the daughter of a merchant of nearby Vidisha. Sanchi was also her birthplace as well
 as the venue of her and Ashoka's wedding. In the 1st century BCE, four elaborately carved toranas (ornamental gateways) and
 a balustrade encircling the entire structure were added. The Sanchi Stupa built during Mauryan period was made of bricks.
 The composite flourished until the 11th century.
